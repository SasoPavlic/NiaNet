# NiaNet 🐺

### Designing and constructing neural network topologies using nature-inspired algorithms

### Description 📝

The proposed method NiaNet attempts to pick hyperparameters and AE architecture that will result in a successful encoding and decoding (minimal difference between input and output). NiaNet uses the collection of algorithms available in the library [NiaPy](https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy) to navigate efficiently in waste search-space.

### What it can do? 👀

* **Construct novel AE's architecture** using nature-inspired algorithms.
* It can be utilized for **any kind of dataset**, which has **numerical** values.

### Requirements ✅

* **Anaconda** enviroment with Python 3.8.x (to run NiaNet script).
* **Setup of project** `pip install .`

### Documentation 📘

This code's paper is currently in the writing stage... (TODO)

### Usage 🔨

##### Changing directory

`cd NiaNet`

##### Configurating parameters

Configure `evolve.cfg` according to your needs. (TODO)

##### Running NiaNet script

`python evolve.py`
