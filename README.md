### Designing and constructing neural network topologies using nature-inspired algorithms

### Description üìù

The proposed method NiaNet attempts to pick hyperparameters and AE architecture that will result in a successful encoding and decoding (minimal difference between input and output). NiaNet uses the collection of algorithms available in the library [NiaPy](https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy) to navigate efficiently in waste search-space.

### What it can do? üëÄ

* **Construct novel AE's architecture** using nature-inspired algorithms.
* It can be utilized for **any kind of dataset**, which has **numerical** values.

### Installation ‚úÖ

Installing NiaNet with pip3: 
```sh
pip3 install nianet
```

### Documentation üìò

The paper referring to this source code is currently being published. The link will be posted here once it is available.

### Examples

Usage examples can be found [here](examples).

### Getting started üî®

##### Create your own example:
In [examples](examples) folder create the Python file based on the existing [evolve_for_diabetes_dataset.py](examples/evolve_for_diabetes_dataset.py).

##### Change dataset:
Change the dataset import function as follows:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
dataset = load_diabetes()
```

##### Specify the search space:

Set the boundaries of your search space with [autoencoder.py](nianet/autoencoder.py).

The following dimensions can be modified:
* Topology shape (symmetrical, asymmetrical)
* Size of input, hidden and output layers
* Number of hidden layers
* Number of neurons in hidden layers
* Activation functions
* Number of epochs
* Learning rate
* Optimizer

You can run the NiaNet script once your setup is complete.
##### Running NiaNet script:

`python evolve_for_diabetes_dataset.py`
